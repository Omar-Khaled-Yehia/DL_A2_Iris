# Iris Species Classification using PyTorch
## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a multiclass classification model using PyTorch to classify iris species based on four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The species can belong to one of the three classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. The target accuracy is +95%, with a comprehensive evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and the ROC-AUC curve (One-vs-Rest strategy for multiclass).

## Dataset Description
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following columns:

1. Sepal Length (cm)
2. Sepal Width (cm)
3. Petal Length (cm)
4. Petal Width (cm)
5. Species (Target variable with 3 classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)
